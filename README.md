JS Demo Bug

1. Two time click on edit then update button without change will be reflect on result  of row 
2. When updated second time it change the other row and object -only hobby and gender remain -other data will replace with empty string
3. List population should reset on every submit or any change in Dom.

Features to add:
1. Validation on input field (also add on onChange & submit i.e check before creating new object)
2. Email should not repeat if enter second time on submission and also create new object
3. Search on every change in search field
